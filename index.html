      1. I only learned how to code from The Newschool's classes. I can now understand how coding works, but because of my small code library, I often find myself unable to execute my vision. I had to seek answers on Google. The funny part is all the answers I found early were what we were learning in class next week. I think coding's fun is in the troubleshooting. The feeling of a functional website with no bugs is satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. I am nervous about coding because I am not yet confident in my ability. But I am also excited at the same time because I was always curious and wanted to understand coding. This is the perfect opportunity for me to finally learn it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. I can't imagine continue using coding in the future as my main design medium. I think I am more of a painting and illustrative person. But this is a skill I am interested to learn because it will be useful as everything will be on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. HTML is basically the building block of a website. CSS and Javascript are add-ons that give more possibility to my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Github is a hosting company that allowed easier access to Git for collaboration and version control.

      14. The gradient uses percentage to define how much a color will occupy the shape

      15. I am personally into a more playful website that explore the interaction between user and the website itself. I see the beauty in both simplicity and complexity, but for this website I would use a clean aesthetic.
    </p>

      16. Personally I am very interested in mouse related tracking in javascript because I want my website's interaction automatic. Last semester I was able to explore and create a "phone screen". Although the code was taken from a formn, I was able to mess around and change it to fit what I want. I would hope to be able to come up with these smart codes all by myself in the future. The one thing I am proud of was the animation I added when interacting and resizing the window
